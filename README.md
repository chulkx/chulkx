### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gustavo


I'm currently a dev student, so I'll do my best to achieve my goal.

I'm studying right now:
  * HTML5
  * CSS
  * JS
  * NODEJS
  * Electron
  * Python
  * QT
  * Django

I'm currently working on the development of an ammeter with data visualization on PC or web.

For this purpose, I'm creating the user interfaces in two platforms:
  * web interface 
  * desk interface

The latter will be done using:
  * Python + QT5
  * JS + Electron

By doing all this, I hope to be able to polish my knowledge in the area while independently
developing a tool that I'll use in my electronics workshop.

Now I'm learning with freecodecamp, you can check my practices on https://codepen.io/ChulkX
