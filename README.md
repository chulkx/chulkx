### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, iÂ´m Gustavo

I'm currently a dev student, so iÂ´ll do my best to achieve my goal.

I'm studying right now:
  * HTML5
  * CSS
  * JS
  * NODEJS
  * Electron
  * Python
  * QT
  * Django

I'm currently working on the developent of an ammeter with data visualization on PC or web.
For this i try to create  the user interfaces in two modes: 
  * web interface 
  * desk interface

The developmente of this last interface i'm going to do in two ways:
  * Python + QT5
  * JS + Electron

By doing all this I hope to be able to perfect my knowledge in the area and to be able to indenpendently develope a tool that I'll use in my electronics workshop.
